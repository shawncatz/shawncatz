# Hey! I'm Shawn Catanzarite

Empathic --- or empathetic, if you prefer --- leadership and management in engineering development and technical
operations. I have over 22 years of experience with a strong background in most facets of the technology industry,
across all sizes and shapes of companies.

Pronunciation: kuh-TAN-zuh-REET

## Leadership / Devops / SRE / Engineering Management / Software Engineering

I'm currently working as an individual contributor in a Devops role using `Terraform` to herd `servers` (cattle). I
also spend quite a bit of time programming in `golang` and `reactjs`.

I've been using `AWS` since the beginning back in 2006/2007. I have extensive experience with most popular languages
and technologies.

## Contact

I'm not very active on social networks, but you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawncatanzarite/).

## Projects

I've been spending quite a bit of my spare time rebuilding my PVR software in `golang` and `reactjs`. It's called
[DashoTV](https://github.com/dashotv). The original PVR project was started over 20 years ago and has evolved considerably
over time. The existing iteration is built with `Ruby on Rails` and `AngularJS`.

I've also been fascinated with Terminal UIs since I started working with [Bubble Tea](github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
