# Hey! I'm Shawn Catanzarite

Empathic --- or empathetic, if you prefer --- leadership and management in engineering development and technical
operations. I have over 22 years of experience with a strong background in most facets of the technology industry,
across all sizes and shapes of companies.

## Leadership / Devops / SRE / Engineering Management / Software Engineering

I'm currently working as an individual contributor in a Devops role using `Terraform` to herd `servers` (cattle). I
also spend quite a bit of time programming in `golang` and `reactjs`.

I've been using `AWS` since the beginning back in 2006/2007. I have extensive experience with most popular languages
and technologies.
